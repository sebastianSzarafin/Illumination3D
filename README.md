## Introduction
This is a project for *Computer Graphics 2022* course on Computer Science course. The application visualizes a 3D surface (in this example a hemisphere), which is illuminated by a simulated sun. The sun is orbiting back and forth above the object.

## Usage
User may interact with an app using the menu placed in a left column of the main window which has following functionalities:
- loading .obj file from user's computer
- showing mesh connecting all the displayed object's vertices

- overlapping the displayed object with an image

- changing the displayed object's normal map

- changing parameters used in painting the displayed object (more info in <b>Painting</b> section) <br>
- changing the speed of displayed object redraw method <br>
- playing/pausing the sun simulation and also modyfying it's height (z coordinate) <br>
- setting the displayed object's and sun's base color <br>
- switching between 2 ways of calculating pixel's color (more info in <b>Painting</b> section)

## Algorithm
The *DrawObj* function from ObjFunctions.cs is the main part of the project. It involves the efficient scan line algorithm with edge bucket sort for filling out the object with a color.
   
   
## Assumptions
* Displayed object has to have it's functional respresentation $z = f(x,y)$ meaning it can be drawn in a 2D plane.
